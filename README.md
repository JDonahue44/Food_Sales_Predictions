# Food_Sales_Predictions

For this project we have used data from Big Mart to help with their Sales Prediction

The data we used for this this project https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/

From this dataset, we were able to organize and clean the data to make insightful predictions evaluations. We started our data cleaning process by making sure all the pieces of data were consistent within their datatypes along with making sure there weren't any duplicates of our data. We followed our cleaning with an exploration of the data where we found insights like the Mean, Minimum & Maximum pieces of data throughout the columns. After the exploration process, we created different visualizations from our data to make our findings more interpretable. Finally, we used Machine Learning to create predictions for Item Outlet Sales from the data we had.
