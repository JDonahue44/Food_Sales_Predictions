# Food_Sales_Predictions

For this project we have used data from Big Mart to help with their Sales Prediction

The data we used for this this project https://datahack.analyticsvidhya.com/contest/practice-problem-big-mart-sales-iii/

From this dataset, we were able to organize and clean the data to make insightful predictions evaluations. We started our data cleaning process by making sure all the pieces of data were consistent within their datatypes along with making sure there weren't any duplicates of our data. We followed our cleaning with an exploration of the data where we found insights like the Mean, Minimum & Maximum pieces of data throughout the columns. After the exploration process, we created different visualizations from our data to make our findings more interpretable. Finally, we used Machine Learning to create predictions for Item Outlet Sales from the data we had. In these seperate seperate files of research you will be able to see how we filtered, cleaned & took insights from our data. We were also able to create visualizations within our code to make these assignments easier to digest for our stake holders. In one of our Visualizations, we created a boxplot showing the variance of the Item_Weight column. We were able to take insights from this data, like knowing the average would sit between 17.5 & around 8 and there were outliers above 20 & below 5. The other visualization I created was a histogram regarding the Item_Fat_Content. Some valuable takeaways from that were the overwhelming amount of products that were low fat vs regular.
